# **MCSC: Climate Tipping Point Analysis**

### **Project Brief**:

<p>The global economy must decarbonize through expanding renewable energy availability and electrifying processes, switching feedstocks, scaling carbon capture utilization and sequestration, and implementing the circular economy. The entire system must be transformed from raw resources to final products. Each company has proposed their own sustainability goals, but what more can be achieved when we bring distinct sectors into the same room and think about the entire system? Recent literature reveals the adoption of new technologies and practices can be accelerated by tipping cascades driven by collective action. Disparate sectors often face common challenges, such as how to collect and utilize dispersed resources (biomass or end-of-life waste), so shared infrastructure, knowledge or policy may be pursued together. We aim to identify and quantify the potential of these opportunities systematically by developing a map of resource flows through the global economy.</p>

### Initial win:

A map of material and energy flows through the global economy showing the interconnections of upstream and downstream sectors. Several key interconnections and potential feedback loops will be investigated with sufficient granularity to quantify the decarbonization potential and barriers.

### Project Goals:

1. Develop initial flow scheme for raw materials > primary industries > secondary industries > societal needs transfromations.
2. Collect, validate, and organize data in shared Excel format
3. Store and visualize data in Python-based Sankey Drawing
4. (*Long-Term Goal*) Develop an interactive visualization of sankey drawing considering different units (energy vs. land vs. water) w/ D3.
